# Vietnamese-Hungarian dictionary

I have been struggling with Hungarian for a long time as it is a really hard language. There are also not a lot of people speeking Hungarian so it was hard to find materials for studying Hungarian as a Vietnamese. That is the reason why I would like to make a Vietnamese-Hungarian dictionary to help other Vietnamese people like me to learn Hungarian better.
